# REAPER

Thank you for trying out my scripts.

The purpose of this project is to bring to Reaper users the confort of using the "Solo in Place" and "Solo Exclusive" actions
using keybard shortcuts (or any means accessible via the Action List).

Coming from Ableton, Protools and Logic Pro, I needed to make reaper work the way I was used to on Ableton for that particular action,
as it is in my opinion, the best implementation of a Solo feature across all DAWs I use daily.
It is simple, predictable and very intuitive to me.

I mapped the actions to [S]= Toggle Solo Exclusive, and [Shift+S]= Toggle Add to Solo.

I hope these while prove useful to your workflow.
