# REAPER ReaScripts

Welcome to my humble repository.
Making the move toward Reaper is a long and painful journey to me, I therefore try to see it as a challenge and an opportunity to become a better developer.
I make scripts to accommodate my own workflow, then share it with the world when it's working.

Thank you for trying out my scripts.

## SCRIPTS:

## Ableton Solo Toggle Behavior (Solo Exclusive / Add to Solo)

The purpose of this project is to bring Reaper users the comfort of using the "Solo in Place" and "Solo Exclusive" actions
using keyboard shortcuts (or any means accessible via the Action List).

Coming from Ableton, Protools, and Logic Pro, I needed to make reaper work the way I was used to on Ableton for that particular action,
as it is in my opinion, the best implementation of a Solo feature across all DAWs I use daily.
It is simple, predictable, and very intuitive to me.

I mapped the actions to [S]= Toggle Solo Exclusive, and [Shift+S]= Toggle Add to Solo.

I hope these will prove useful to your workflow.
